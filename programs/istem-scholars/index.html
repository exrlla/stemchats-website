                    <p class = "box-description">The i-STEM Scholars team is excited to announce that the i-STEM Scholars Summer Research Program application (below) is currently accepting applications! The application will close at 11:59 PM PST on March 26, 2021. Visit the <a href = "https://scholars.stemchats.org/" target = "_blank">i-STEM Scholars website</a> to learn more!</p>
                    <p class = "box-description">The i-STEM Scholars Research Program is a remote STEM education program for underrepresented high school students to be remotely paired with Research Mentors from all across the US. Our Research Mentors come from fields including (but not limited to) neuroscience, robotics, cell biology, computer science, physics, environmental science, and organic chemistry. For 10 weeks during the summer (June 7th - August 16th), students will learn about the basics of STEM research, delve deeper into a particular field of STEM, improve science communication skills, receive personal and college mentorship, and much more.</p>
                    <p class = "box-description">Our program is specifically designed for <b>high school students with limited background in STEM research</b>, and specifically targets students from first-generation college, low-income, traditionally underrepresented, and minoritized backgrounds. The application is open to all US-based students who will be in high school during the 2021-2022 school year. If you have questions about whether you are eligible, please check out the application for more information!</p>
                    <p class = "box-description">Students can preview the written application questions <a href="https://bit.ly/istem2021preview" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
