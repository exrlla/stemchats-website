                    <p class = "box-description">United Engineers is one of STEMchat’s Stimulate programs, providing opportunities for students year-round. In the summer, United Engineers hosts virtual design thinking challenges which students ages 16-18 can join to propose solutions to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, the program’s main goal is to engage middle school students from low-income, first generation, and minority backgrounds through 10-week workshops during the school year. We work with public middle schools in <b>New York, NY, West Lafayette, IN, and Lafayette, IN</b>. Depending on the locations and school calendars, these local workshops occur between August and May during fall and spring school semesters.</p>

                    <h3 class = "medium-box-subtitle">COVID-19 Notice</h3>
                    <p class = "box-description">Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided to forego hosting in-person workshops in the interest of public safety. Over the last few months, we have been working tirelessly to develop virtual programming experiences so we can carry out our mission while still protecting the wellbeing of our participants and coordinators. In June 2020 and February 2021, we hosted virtual Impact Ideathons and had over 260 registered participants for both combined. Check out our website (linked above) for updates for more Impact Ideathon experiences as they come! Furthermore, our team has been working diligently to convert our in-person curriculum into a virtual experience. We are so excited to be able to share this with you in the future. More information on this will be shared as it is developed further.</p>
                    <h3 class = "medium-box-subtitle">The Difference</h3>
                    <p class = "box-description">Participants gain significant STEM knowledge and apply it to develop a product or idea focused on  sustainability. During the first five weeks of the program, students are taught the Engineering Design Process and other engineering fundamentals like efficiency, mechanical advantage, and making decisions through activity-based lessons. During the last five weeks, students <b>develop solutions to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</b> in groups under mentorship of our team and present them to the community at a Demo Day.</p>
                    <p class = "box-description">Students may also choose to enter their projects in a city-wide competition for the chance to win a free trip to the United Nations Headquarters and access to mentors, professionals, and fiscal resources to <b>further develop and realize their sustainable solutions</b>. The program is completely free for schools and youth organizations. United Engineers provides volunteers, curriculum, resources for building and for professional opinion, recognition and incentives, and recruitment materials.</p>

                    <p class = "box-description">United Engineers has also established its first student-led chapter at Purdue University located in West Lafayette, IN. The chapter, Purd.UE, will focus its efforts on extending United Engineer’s mission to the local area. In order to do so, Purd.UE will host STEM workshops and events that will benefit the local area. Using peer-to-peer education models, Purd.UE hopes to improve STEM education and retention rates in West Lafayette, IN and Lafayette, IN.</p>
                    <h3 class = "medium-box-subtitle">How You Can Help</h3>
                    <p class = "box-description">If you are interested in bringing United Engineers to your school and establishing a chapter like Purd.UE, please do not hesitate to reach out to our team at <a href="mailto:unitedengineers@stemchats.org">unitedengineers@stemchats.org</a>. We are a rapidly growing student-run organization that hopes to meet the great demand for desired STEM literacy amongst all young people, and we would be thrilled to hear from you.</p>
                    <p class = "box-description">If you’re a high school or college student, apply to be a United Engineers Intern through our annual summer STEMchats Internship Program! </p>
