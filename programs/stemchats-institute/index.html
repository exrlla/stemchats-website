                    <p class = "box-description">STEMchats Institute is a <b>STEM-focused workshop</b> series designed to impact all students, especially those from disadvantaged and minority backgrounds. Our non-cumulative six-week program provides intro-level science curriculum and STEM-related career workshops at public middle schools though <b> the team is currently developing a digital/physical STEM workbook targeted at middle school students to supplement classroom learning. </b></p>

                    <!-- <p class = "box-description">As high school and college students ourselves — where many of us are also a part of the low-income, first generation community — we understand how schools often lack the resources to properly prepare their students for future careers. As a result, the STEMchats Institute program was created to <b>make STEM education and knowledge on its career possibilities accessible</b>.</p> -->
                    <!-- <p class = "box-description">As STEMchats Institute continues to expand across the nation, we will be operational in as many as three US metropolitan areas by this fall. During our workshop programs, we <b>encourage students to tackle a new STEM concept every week</b>, ranging from physics to psychology, and to ultimately apply their passion and skills beyond the classroom.</p>
                    <h3 class = "medium-box-subtitle">The Difference</h3> -->
                    <p class = "box-description">Our mission is to stimulate the desire for more comprehensive STEM education among the middle schoolers throughout underfunded districts within the US. As a program run for students, by students, STEMchat’s Institute will be an annual, high-impact initiative that hopes to <b>shatter barriers in the STEM fields</b> through a transformative STEM education.</p>
                    <p class = "box-description">Amidst the COVID-19 Global Pandemic, we are taking a strong stance in assisting middle schools nationwide with the transition to online instruction. To facilitate our goal of stimulating joy around STEM in all middle schoolers, we’re tirelessly working on the <b>first edition of an official STEMchats Institute digital/physical STEM workbook targeted at Middle School Students who are unable to get a hands-on connection with the science curriculums they are used to.</b> Through partnerships with an increasingly larger network of national middle schools, we are prepared to revolutionize online education through working directly with on-the-ground [in-the-Zoom] educators. <b>Look out for more information on our upcoming project developments through our media channels.</b></p>
                    <!-- <p class = "box-description">Our six week long workshop centered around a theme of “Building Blocks” aims to create collaborative workshops that expose young students to a variety of STEM fields. Workshops are taught using a <b>peer-to-peer technique at underserved schools</b> in order to demonstrate the positive and transformative applications of STEM through hands-on activities, engaged discussion, and real time feedback.</p>
                    <p class="aligncenter">

                    <h3 class = "medium-box-subtitle">Work with Us</h3>
                    <p class = "box-description">We’re here to <b>empower young people and meet a community need</b>.  With STEMchats Institute, you’ll be joining a team of students from across the country who are passionate about STEM education and willing to step outside their comfort zones. Our focus on peer-to-peer workshops encourages both our team and the students we hope to impact to gain a deeper understanding of the world through a STEM perspective.</p>
                    <p class = "box-description">Joining our team will provide you with the opportunity to improve your skills in teaching and science communication—especially when <b>making complex topics engaging and accessible</b> to younger audiences—and have a positive impact on minority youth.</p>
                    <p class = "box-description">If you are interested in bringing STEMchats Institute to your school, please do not hesitate to reach out to our team at <b>stemchatsinstitute.stemchats@gmail.com</b>. We are a rapidly growing student-run organization that hopes to meet the great demand for desired STEM literacy amongst all young people, and we would be thrilled to hear from you.</p> -->
                    <p class = "box-description"><b><i>If as a middle school administrator or educator you find yourself interested in this initiative, please do not hesitate to reach out to our team at stemchatsinstitute.stemchats@gmail.com</i></b></p>
                    <p class = "box-description">Our concerted focus will remain to <b>uplift</b> students in underfunded and under resourced schools around this country. The current educational climate drastically affects students of color and those within lower income communities so our focus, as a team of some minority FGLI (first-generation, low-income) students, will be to speak to and uplift the students we often see ourselves in. Focusing on a future video series on specific scientific topics along with homework help to make sure students feel <b>empowered and supported</b> in their education so they have the extra energy to ask those groundbreaking questions that may launch the next technological, ecological, or sociological STEM innovation. Alongside it all, we seek to <b>highlight minority and women STEM</b> revolutionaries to help students identify themselves with the often underrated and leaders that they are closely following the footsteps of. </p>
