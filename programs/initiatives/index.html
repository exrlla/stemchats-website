                    <p class="box-description">The <b>STEMchats Speaker Series</b> Initiative seeks to inspire, engage,
                        and <b>educate students (ages 14-22) about various STEM topics</b> by hosting <b>monthly speaker
                            sessions</b>. Each month, we will feature a STEM professional in the field of tech,
                        academia, medicine, and beyond. We aim to highlight speakers from a diverse range of personal
                        and educational backgrounds.</p>
                    <p class="box-description">Our goal is to encourage students to pursue different educational and
                        professional paths that they would have otherwise not thought was a possibility. In addition,
                        students will be able to learn more about the field they're interested in directly through a
                        professional in that field.</p>
